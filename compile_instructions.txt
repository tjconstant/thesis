Increase in memory required for mactex:

To change the memory allocation you should edit /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf.cnf. On a Mac, these are files owned by the system, and you can't edit them without authenticating as an administrative user.

There are two ways to do this. If you are comfortable with a command line editor such as vi, emacs, pico or nano (all standardly installed in the MacOS) you can use one of these editors to edit the file. To do so you invoke the editor using sudo from an admin account. (Example below, using emacs).

sudo emacs /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf.cnf
You will be prompted for your password.

If you are not familiar with any of these editors, and would prefer to do this from the regular GUI interface, you can use a good text editor such as the free TextWrangler which will allow you to save system files after authenticating. To do this from the finder, you can do the following:

In the Go menu, choose Go to Folder
Enter /usr/local/texlive/2011/
Control-click on texmf.cnf and choose Open with, then select TextWrangler
Now you can edit the file, and when you save it, TextWrangler will authenticate you.

To increase the main memory to e.g. 7000000 add the line:

main_memory = 7000000 
After you modify /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf.cnf you need to run

sudo fmtutil-sys --all
This should rebuild the formats with the new values.

It is important that you run sudo fmtutil-sys and NOT fmtutil.

If you have previously run fmtutil by mistake, you should remove the following folder from your local Library (i.e. ~/Library/)

~/Library/texlive/2011/texmf-var
You can do this by navigating to the ~/Library/texlive/2011/ folder and dragging the texmf-var folder to the trash. Alternatively, from the command line you can type:

rm -rf ~/Library/texlive/2011/texmf-var
