\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we examine the propagation of SPPs on periodic surfaces with the lowest possible order of symmetry. The underlying Bravais lattice for these grating is oblique, containing no reflection or rotational symmetry operations, save for the one inversion operation shared by every possible Bravais lattice.

Section \ref{s:ob-coords} discusses the oblique grating samples, their fabrication, the coordinate system used and the reciprocal space lattice for an oblique grating. A comparison between experiment and a theoretical model for a typical SPP iso-frequency contour in $k$-space on such a grating is presented in section \ref{s:ob-coupling}. The mapped dispersion of SPPs on this geometry are recorded, with which their band-structure on the fabricated oblique gratings are explained. Polarisation conversion mediated by SPPs is also found on the oblique grating, with SPPs travelling in directions which are not in the plane of incidence rotating the reflected light's polarisation.

The most striking result in this chapter is that this low-symmetry class of grating is shown to be the only exception for the formation of band-gaps at Brillouin Zone (BZ) boundaries of all the 2D Bravais lattices. We show experimentally in section \ref{s:ob-BZ} that an SPP propagating across a BZ boundary does not split to form a band-gap, and offer a generalised symmetry discussion as to why this is so. The dispersion of SPPs along axes containing the unique points of high-symmetry on an oblique grating are obtained experimentally, and it is shown that for these discrete planes of incidence, SPP band-gaps at BZ boundaries are still formed due to the symmetry of these axes.

\section{The Oblique Grating\label{s:ob-coords}}

An oblique lattice is formed of an infinite array of lattice points separated by two lattice vectors of different magnitudes, oriented at an angle with respect to each other $\alpha$, such that $\alpha \neq 90^\circ$. To realise this symmetry using surface-relief gratings, two diffraction gratings of different pitches are `crossed' at an angle $\alpha$ such that $\alpha\not= 90^\circ$, forming an oblique bigrating.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Coordinate system for an oblique bigrating. The typical design paramters used in this chapter are $\lambda_{gx}=600\:\nano\metre, \lambda_{gy}=400\:\nano\metre, \alpha=75^\circ, d_1=d_2=40\:\nano\metre$.\label{fig:obl-coords}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The coordinate system for this type of grating is shown in figure \ref{fig:obl-coords}. The plane of incidence is defined at an azimuthal angle of $\phi$ so that when $\phi=0^\circ$ the wavevector of incidence light lies along the $x$-direction. When the electric field vector of the impinging radiation is contained within the plane of incidence, the light is said to be TM polarised, and when the electric vector lies orthogonal to the plane, it is TE polarised. The $x$-direction is collinear with the grating vector $\mathbf{k}_{gx}=2\pi\hat{\mathbf{x}}/\lambda_{gx}$ for the longer-pitch monograting, which possesses a periodicity of $\lambda_{gx}$. This period, for all the gratings presented in this chapter, is $\lambda_{gx}=600\:\nano\metre$. The second, shorter-pitch grating lies at an angle of $\alpha=75^\circ$ along the $v$ axis (defined in the plane of the $xy$ plane at an angle $\alpha$ to $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$) and for the grating presented in this chapter has a period $\lambda_{gv}=400\:\nano\metre$. As before, the grating vector of this short-pitch grating is defined as $\mathbf{k}_{gv}=2\pi\hat{\mathbf{v}}/\lambda_{gv}$. An angle of $\alpha=75^\circ$ was chosen to lie midway between the high symmetry cases of $\alpha=60^\circ$ (hexagonal-like) and $\alpha=90^\circ$ (square/rectangular). The fill fraction of the gratings is designed as $\Gamma_x=\Gamma_v=0.5$. The depths of the gratings are $d_1$ and $d_2$, and are chosen in this chapter so that $d_1 = d_2 \approx 40\:\nano\metre$.

The reciprocal space map of the corresponding lattice is shown in figure \ref{fig:obl-rcpspace} and constitutes the lowest symmetry lattice set of all the two-dimensional Bravais lattices. 
\begin{figure}
\centering \input{figure-75degObliqueLattice}
\caption{Example reciprocal lattices for an oblique grating. $\lambda_{gx}= 600$ nm, $\lambda_{gv}=400$ nm and the angles between the two periodicities is $\alpha = 75^\circ$\label{fig:obl-rcpspace} }
\end{figure} 
The reciprocal lattice of the oblique grating is itself oblique, with the reciprocal lattice vectors defined as $\mathbf{k}_{gx}$ and $\mathbf{k}_{gv}$, oriented at an angle $\alpha^\star = 180^\circ-75^\circ=105^\circ$ with respect to each other. The only symmetry operation possible for this oblique lattice is a rotation around a lattice point of $180^\circ$, which for 2D lattices is the equivalent of a inversion operation. Centred about each lattice point are circles representing various scattered iso-frequency contours. The circles formed with solid lines show the contours for a grazing photon, and the dashed lines represent the iso-frequency contours for scattered SPPs which lie outside their respective grazing-photon lines (diffraction lines) due to the greater momentum of SPPs compared to light. In this simple cartoon, the SPPs do not interact and cross through each other unperturbed. However, if the SPPs interact to form band-gaps these iso-frequency contours will deform as detailed in chapter \ref{c:experimentalmethods}. The black circle is the case of the un-scattered zero-order light, which is the region of $k$-space accessible for mapping using the experimental method of imaging scatterometry.

\end{figure}

The gratings for this chapter were fabricated using electron beam lithography (EBL) and the template stripping method outlined in chapter \ref{c:experimentalmethods}. A scanning electron mircograph of a fabricated oblique grating master in silicon is shown in figure \ref{fig:obl-sample}. The target parameters of this grating were ${\lambda_{gx}= 600 \:\nano\metre}$, ${\lambda_{gv}= 400 \:\nano\metre}, {\Gamma_x=\Gamma_v=0.5,d_1=d_2=40\:\nano\metre}$.

\section{Coupling of Light and SPP Mode Interaction on Oblique Gratings\label{s:ob-coupling}}
A square profile grating such as those fabricated using EBL contain little or no even-Fourier components in their surface profile (see chapter \ref{c:rectangular}). Consequently, the momentum of a plane wave incident on such a grating may be modified with direct scattering events with values of $\pm m\mathbf{k}_g$, where $m$ is odd.  A direct scattering event, where the plane wave is modified by $\pm n\mathbf{k}_g$, where $n$ is even, is not possible on a grating where $\Gamma=0.5$. There does exist, however, the opportunity for the plane wave to be modified by a total value of $\pm n\mathbf{k}_g$ through multiple-scattering processes, summing the contributions from $\pm m\mathbf{k}_g$ scattering events. These multiple scattering events are found in experiment to be so weak that they are rarely experimentally observed. 

These scattering efficiencies also dictate the strength of interaction between counter-propagating SPP modes. Modes that are separated by a direct scattering event will interact strongly. Little, if any, interaction is observed for modes separated by the weaker multiple-scattering process.

Figure \ref{fig:oblique-chandezon-exp-comparison} shows the theoretical and experimentally measured iso-frequency contours for an oblique bigrating at $\lambda_0=700\:\nano\metre$.  Figure \ref{fig:oblique-chandezon-exp-comparisonA} shows the numerical prediction using the Chandezon method, approximating the square groove profiles with the Fourier sums,
\begin{align}
F(x) &= \sum\limits_{n=1}^3  \frac{4A}{n \pi}\cos{\frac{2 n \pi x}{\lambda_{gx}}}\\
F(y) &= \sum\limits_{n=1}^3  \frac{4A}{n \pi}\cos{\frac{2 n \pi v}{\lambda_{gv}}}
\end{align}
Providing a suitable approximation to a lamella bi-grating with a depth of $2A=40\:\nano\metre$, $\lambda_{gx}=600\:\nano\metre$, $\lambda_{gv}=400\:\nano\metre$, $\alpha=75^\circ$ and $\Gamma=0.5$. The dielectric function of silver is taken from literature \cite{Nash1996}, and for the illuminating wavelength of $700\:\nano\metre$ is equal to $\varepsilon=-23.13+0.59i$. The light in the theoretical plot is TM polarised for every azimuthal angle. Only the $n=1,3$ components are included in the calculation, as the even components are considered to be absent for a grating with $\Gamma=0.5$.

The corresponding experimentally obtained iso-frequency surface is shown in figure \ref{fig:oblique-chandezon-exp-comparisonB}. The contour is obtained using imaging scatterometry detailed in chapter \ref{c:experimentalmethods}.  For the illuminating wavelength of $700\:\nano\metre$, the contrast of the entire SPP contour to the background is weak, making the determination of the mode position in $k$-space difficult. To improve the contrast, the polarisers of the scatterometer are crossed, producing a dark background reflectivity against which the polarisation conversion mediated by the SPPs \cite{Bryan-Brown1990} provides greater contrast for the mode positions. The four bright lobes of high reflectivity is polarisation conversion mediated by the ellipsoidal mirror in the apparatus (see chapter \ref{c:experimentalmethods}).  

The modelled values for the mode position (taken from the theoretical plot at the position of reflectivity minima) found in figure \ref{fig:oblique-chandezon-exp-comparisonA} are plotted on the experimental results in figure \ref{fig:oblique-chandezon-exp-comparisonB} as yellow circles, and show good agreement, especially considering the simplicity of the model. This shows that the dominant scattering amplitudes in the observable SPP band structure are only the $n=1,3$ components. 

In the upper half-space of figure \ref{fig:oblique-chandezon-exp-comparisonA}, three SPP contour crossings are labelled A-C\footnote{These mode crossings are equivalent through an inversion symmetry operation to the crossings in the lower half-space}. Crossing point A is the meeting of a $(-1,0)$ and a $(0,1)$ Bragg scattered SPP contour. These two SPP curves are separated in  $k$-space by a minimum of two scattering vectors, and so require a multiple scattering process to interact with each other. With no $2^{nd}$ order harmonics in the grating profile, the interaction is weak and no band-gap is observed. The crossing point B is the intersection of the $(0,1)$ and $(1,1)$ SPPs. This is a process by which the SPPs must scatter a total of $1\mathbf{k}_{gx}$ to interact, and so a small band-gap forms. At point C, the $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ SPP cross. These are separated by a single scattering vector $1\mathbf{k}_{gv}$, and so interact, forming a large band-gap.

The coupling efficiencies of plane-polarised light to all these SPP modes is strong as the majority of the contours present are Bragg scattered back into the light circle by a single scattering vector, which is inherent in the grating profile. The exception is the $(1,1)$ SPP, (the contour between points B and C), which is scattered back in to the light circle by a multiple scattering process. It is, however, observed quite strongly between points B and C, though not strongly (and observed as a weak bright band) outside of these points. 

This coupling between points B and C is an example of SPPs `self-coupling', the $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ SPPs coupling to the SPP contour close to the crossing points where there is a component of the SPPs that fulfil the required energy and momentum matching conditions for the $(1,1)$ mode. These well coupled $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ SPPs resonantly drive the $(1,1)$ SPP, resulting in its observation as a dark band.

\end{table}

These interactions can also be observed by mapping the dispersion relation of the SPPs by recording the zero-order reflectivity from the sample as a function of polar angle and wavelength. TE polarised light is incident on the sample and the reflectivity measured for the wavelength range ${400 \:\nano\metre < \lambda_0 < 850 \:\nano\metre}$ and the angle range ${7^\circ<\theta<75^\circ}$ (see chapter \ref{c:experimentalmethods}). These experimental results are shown in figure \ref{fig:obliquedispcoloured} for an azimuthal angle of $\phi=75^\circ$, with the plane of incidence containing $\mathbf{k}_{gv}$. To facilitate the discussion of mode interactions, the dark-bands of low reflectivity which map the SPP dispersion have been colour coded depending upon which dominant scattering event the SPP contour is associated with. The associated diffraction lines have also been coloured accordingly. These scattering interactions between the present modes are summarised in the companion table \ref{tbl:obliquecouping}. 

The band gaps are clearly observed for the interactions between the $(1,0)$ scattered SPP band (green) and the $(1,1)$ scattered SPP band (blue). Another large band-gap is observed for the interaction of the $(-1,1)$ scattered SPP (cyan) and the $(-1,0)$ scattered SPP (red), which again are SPPs separated in $k$-space by a single grating vector of $1\mathbf{k}_{gv}$.

A smaller band-gap is also observed for the $(-1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ SPP crossing (red and blue bands, respectively). This coupling is mediated either by multiple scattering events or a weak direct-scatter due to a small deviation in $\Gamma$ away from the designed value of 0.5, and consequently the frequency gap formed is small in comparison to the other observed band-gaps.

The presence of a dark band associated with the $(1,1)$ scattered SPP is clearly observed in the mapped dispersion and coloured as a blue band of low reflectivity, despite the ($1,1$) scattering event requiring multiple scattering with which to interact with zero-order light. This region of the dispersion is observed for the same reason the iso-frequency contour between points B and C in figure \ref{fig:oblique-chandezon-exp-comparison} is observed, a component of the ($-1,0$) and ($1,0$) SPP fields present on the surface resonantly drive this mode. The SPPs have `self-coupled'. A very small reflectivity minimum (not coloured) lies between the red $(-1,0)$ and the green $(1,0)$ scattered SPP bands. There is also weak self-coupling of these modes to the in-plane $(0,1)$ SPP (its presence cannot be attributed to the incident light field, as the incident light's polarisation state is incorrect for its excitation for this orientation).

\section{Polarisation Conversion}

In this section we discuss how SPPs on an oblique bigrating mediate the rotation of the incident field's polarisation. An example is experimentally demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:oblique-polcov}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\subfigure[$R_{TE:TE}, \phi=75^\circ$]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figure-oblique-RppAtPhi75-Rss}\label{fig:oblique-polcovA}}

\end{center}
\caption{(a) Polarisation conservation and (b) conversion mediated by out-of-plane scattered SPPs on an oblique grating.\label{fig:oblique-polcov}}
\end{figure}

This figure shows the reflectivity of an oblique grating as a function of $(\omega,k_v)$, mapping the SPP dispersion by the characteristic minima in reflected intensity.  For subfigure \ref{fig:oblique-polcovA}, the incident polarisation is set to be TE polarised, and the detector's polariser is also set to TE. The corresponding polarisation conversion signal is recorded by rotating the detector's polariser by $90^\circ$ to TM, and is shown in figure \ref{fig:oblique-polcovB}. The bright bands of polarisation converted signal lie along the same SPP contours, showing that it is the surface waves which mediate this polarisation conversion.

The polarisation converted signal is normalised to the reference spectrum with both polarisers set to TE polarised, and with this definition, only a maximum of $\approx 5\%$ of the light coupled into the SPPs is re-radiated in to the orthogonal polarisation state. Additionally, the SPP modes in the plane (which travel collinear to the wavevector $\mathbf{k}_{gv}$), do not participate in this polarisation conversion as the SPPs are travelling along a mirror-plane of the grating associated with the $\mathbf{k}_{gv}$ direction (although there are no mirror planes associated with the overall bigrating structure). This is an important point: SPP mediated polarisation conversion occurs only when the SPPs are travelling along the surface in a direction out of the plane of incidence and along a direction of broken mirror symmetry. An oblique bigrating always provides out-of-plane scattering mechanisms and so polarisation conversion will always be observed for out-of-plane scattered SPPs. If, however, the plane of incidence contains a grating vector, conservation of momentum dictates that the SPP associated with this grating vector will travel along  in the plane of incidence and polarisation conversion does not occur, even though the SPP is traversing a surface of broken symmetry.

\section{SPPs at the BZ Boundary of Oblique Bigratings\label{s:ob-BZ}}
The formation of photonic band-gaps on an oblique bigrating is of interest, as in this section we present results that show that on a surface with such broken symmetry the locations in $k$-space of SPP standing waves do not necessarily occur at the BZ boundary. This concept is known for the band-gaps that occur for electron propagation in semiconductor crystals \cite{Iva}, but has not previously been demonstrated for SPPs on gratings. To show this clearly, we must identify how photonic band-gaps are illustrated in the iso-frequency contours recorded with imaging scatterometry.
The iso-frequency image obtained using scatterometry maps $k$-space at a single frequency, with SPP bands seen as an anomaly in the reflected light. 
The group velocity of a general propagating wave is defined as,
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_g = \nabla_k\: \omega(\mathbf{k})
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{v}_g$ is the group velocity, $\omega(\mathbf{k})$ is the angular frequency of the wave as a function of wavevector, $\mathbf{k}$, and $\nabla_k$ is the gradient operator with respect to $k$. For a small change in frequency $d\omega$, the corresponding small movement in $k$-space, $d\mathbf{k}$, is related to this group velocity simply by,
\begin{equation}
d\omega = \nabla_k\: \omega(\mathbf{k}) \cdot d\mathbf{k}
\end{equation}
For an iso-frequency contour, there must be no change in frequency along the contour ($d\omega=0$). Setting $d\omega=0$ restricts the values of $d\mathbf{k}$ to those values that move along a contour of equal frequency. It is then apparent that in the resultant expression,
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_g \cdot d\mathbf{k} = 0
\end{equation}
that $\mathbf{v}_g$ lies perpendicular to $d\mathbf{k}$.
This is true for any general contour of constant frequency. If the group velocity in one direction falls to zero at a boundary, such as at the BZ boundary,  the iso-frequency SPP contour will intersect that boundary perpendicularly.

Plasmonic band-gaps on surface relief gratings are covered in chapter \ref{c:backgroundtheory}. To briefly recap, when a SPP meets an equivalent, counter-propagating SPP a standing wave forms. There are generally two possible arrangements of the electric field  for a SPP standing wave on a grating, which will generally differ in energy. This leads to an upper and lower energy band, with an energy range between where SPP propagation is forbidden.
The energy gap size is dependent on the energy of the two possible field distributions, and so is linked intimately to the surface geometry. The surface profile also provides the scattering mechanism by which SPPs Bragg scatter to meet counter-propagating SPPs and form these standing waves. The strength of this scattering, and so the amplitude of the Bragg scattered SPP, was discussed earlier in chapter \ref{c:rectangular} and affects the magnitude in energy of the band-gap.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ob-650scatterALL} shows the mapped iso-frequency contours of SPPs for the oblique grating at a wavelength of $\lambda_0=650\:\nano\metre$. The position of the SPP contours are found to present as bands of low reflectivity, with the polariser of the experiment chosen in this case to best couple light to the $(\pm 1,0)$ modes. Also annotated on the figure are the diffracted light circles (blue lines) and the BZ boundary formed using the Wigner-Seitz method \cite{kittel1996introduction} (green line).

It is observed that the SPP contour passes through the BZ boundary  seemingly unperturbed. Figure \ref{fig:obl-scattZoom} shows the two regions in which this occurs in greater detail. In figure \ref{fig:obl-scattZoomA} the SPP contour following the $(-1,0)$ diffracted light circle is shown to pass through the BZ at an angle which is not perpendicular to the boundary. This means that at the boundary, the SPP's group velocity in the $(0,1)$ direction is not zero, and no standing-wave states in this direction have formed. The $(0,1)$ scattered SPP is not observed in this figure as the polarisation of the illuminating light has been chosen to only couple strongly to the $(1,0)$ SPP. Additionally the $(-1,0)$ and (uncoupled) $(0,1)$ SPPs are not seen to interact, separated as they are by a weak multiple scattering process. 

The same behaviour is observed in the second region in figure \ref{fig:obl-scattZoomB}. Here, a band-gap has formed inside the BZ\footnote{Recall that the SPP eigenmodes are unaffected by the coupling of the light, and so although some branches of the SPP contours are uncoupled to light in this scattergram, the band-gap still exists.}, but the group velocity at the BZ boundary is still finite. This highlights the fact that the mode crossing positions on an oblique grating do not coincide with BZ boundary constructed using the Wigner-Seitz method. 

A Brillioun Zone boundary in reciprocal space outlines a unit cell in the reciprocal lattice and contains on the boundary points of high-symmetry. One way to determine a boundary that contains the maximum amount of high-symmetry points is to connect the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors connecting the nearest neighbours to one lattice point, a method known as the Wigner-Seitz method. The area mapped out by this method, for the highly-symmetric cases of square, rectangular or hexagonal lattices, is exactly equivalent to the area we call the Brillioun Zone, and no other choice of unit cell contains as many points of high-symmetry in the boundary.

\begin{figure}
\centering \input{figure-possibleBZoblique.tex}
\caption{Two possible Brillioun Zones for an oblique lattice. The Wigner-Seitz cell (\color{red}red\color{black}) and a simple trapezium (\color{blue}blue\color{black}) contain on their boundaries the points of high symmetry labelled $i_1,i_2,i_3$.\label{fig:highsysmpoints-oblique}}
\end{figure}

In the oblique case, we may again use the Wigner-Seitz method to construct a perfectly valid BZ, shown in figure \ref{fig:highsysmpoints-oblique} as the area bounded by a red line. In this figure, it is seen that the only points of high symmetry on the oblique lattice are the singular points lying midway along the perpendicular bisectors, and are labelled $i_1,i_2$ and $i_3$. These points are equivalent to the points $i_1^*,i_2^*$ and $i_2^*$ by a rotation operation of $180^\circ$, and are isolated points of symmetry.  However, this unit cell is not a unique choice, we can easily contain these points of high-symmetry lying on the boundary of a unit cell by using instead a trapezoidal unit cell, as shown by a blue line. In conclusion: The most primitive unit cell of an oblique lattice is not unique. 

The arbitrary choice of the unit cell which contains the high symmetry points, and that both choices is as useful as the conventional BZ in the oblique case, highlights that the properties of physical phenomena on the lattice are determined, not by the BZ boundary, but by the symmetry operations of the lattice.

Neumann’s principle with respect to our system requires that the physical properties of phenomena associated with the grating possess the same symmetry as the point symmetry group of the grating \cite{Newnham2005}. While we could discuss specific propagation properties of the surface modes with respect to its lattice, let us instead generalize these concepts to some arbitrary vector field and see what restrictions the symmetry of the grating places upon it.
Figure \ref{fig:ob-vecorfields} shows an arbitrary vector, $\mathbf{r}$ lying on the boundary of a rectangular or oblique unit cell. In the case of a rectangular grating, the mirror and translational symmetry allows the deduction of the other shown vectors through various reflections in the $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_h$ planes or rotations about the $C$ point. These vectors sum to give a magnitude of zero in the direction perpendicular to the zone boundary. Whether this vector field represents the SPP’s momentum, group velocity or Poynting vector, the conclusion is the same: a standing wave forms perpendicular to the BZ boundary.
\begin{figure}
\centering \input{figure-symmetryofrecandoblique1.tex}
\caption{Applying the symmetry operations of the rectangular BZ (left), an arbitrary vector, $\mathbf{r}$ (lying on the BZ boundary) corresponds to seven other vectors of known magnitude and direction. The summation of these vectors leads to no perpendicular component of the vector at the BZ boundary. In the oblique case (right), there is no such condition, the $C_2$ rotation operation only placing constraints on three additional vectors.\label{fig:ob-vecorfields}}
\end{figure}
In the plasmonic case, a SPP has Bragg-scattered and interfered with a counter-propagating SPP. The interference between these two SPPs, which by symmetry can be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, forms a standing wave. The symmetry considerations we have outlined show us that this is possible, with no restrictions on a ‘mirrored’ SPP occupying the same position and, importantly, that their vector properties will have equal magnitudes and so interfere completely. The two possible field arrangements for SPP standing waves on gratings lead to two solutions of different energies with a forbidden band of no propagating waves between the two: a plasmonic band gap. These are observed experimentally as discontinuities of the SPP curves at the BZ boundary, as was seen in chaptrer \ref{c:rectangular}. 

Using the same approach, we apply the symmetry operations of the oblique lattice to an arbitrary vector field in figure \ref{fig:ob-vecorfields}. With no mirror symmetry, the oblique lattice possesses only translational and a two-fold rotation symmetry operations (a two fold rotation operation is equivalent in two dimensions to an inversion operation). As shown in the figure, there are no special conditions on the vectors lying along the BZ boundary formed using the Weigner-Seitz method, and no condition for the vectors to cancel perfectly. Standing waves do not necessarily occur at the BZ boundary. 

This leads to the observation that the band-gaps observed do not form at the BZ boundaries, but simply where the SPP meets a Bragg scattered counter-propagating SPP.

The mid-points of BZ boundaries are of high symmetry in both rectangular and oblique cases (points $i_1,i_2, i_3$ in figure \ref{fig:highsysmpoints-oblique}), and do allow the total cancellation of our vector field. We can observe the points of zero group velocity at these BZ boundaries by mapping the dispersion of the SPP mode in the special cases of $\phi=0^\circ$ and $\phi=75^\circ$, which place the plane of incidence intersecting points $i_1$ and $i_2$ in figure \ref{fig:highsysmpoints-oblique}. In these cases, we fully expect a band-gap to be present at the BZ boundary. These plots are shown in figure \ref{fig:obl-dispersionaroundhighsym}. In the case of of a dispersion diagram such as this, zero group velocity is shown as $\partial \omega/\partial k_{\parallel} = 0$. 

\section{Conclusions}

In this chapter, SPPs propagating on an oblique bigrating have been investigated. The dispersion of these surface modes has been mapped and the SPP interactions discussed in terms of the available scattering amplitudes of the grating. Polarisation conversion is observed on this grating, as SPPs travelling in a direction other than the plane of incidence mediate the rotation of the light's polarisation state.

Using imaging scatterometry, it is observed that the SPP contours are not perturbed as they pass through the conventional BZ boundary. A generalized discussion on the symmetry of the BZ is presented, concluding that this is because the BZ boundary on an oblique grating is not a contour of high symmetry, and only contain isolated points around which the symmetry conditions may be met for the formation of SPP standing waves. Finally, when the plane of incidence intersects these unique points, SPP band gaps may still be observed.
