abstract = {Diffraction gratings play a very important educational role in describing wave
                properties of light. In this work we present a simple phasor technique to fully
                describe binary amplitude diffraction gratings with different slit widths relative
                to the grating period, as well as binary phase gratings with different phase shift.
                This analysis, which is directly derived from the Huygens principle, introduces a
                slit phasor to account for the diffracted orders relative intensity, and a grating
                phasor that accounts for the grating�s resolving power. The proposed phasor
                technique is mathematically equivalent to the Fourier transform calculation of the
                diffraction orders amplitude, and it can be useful to explain binary diffraction
                gratings in a simple manner in introductory physics courses. Experimental results
                probing this theoretical analysis are included with the use of a liquid crystal
                display.},

abstract = {The brilliant structural body colours of many animals are created by three-dimensional biological photonic crystals that act as wavelength-specific reflectors. Here, we report a study on the vividly coloured scales of the diamond weevil, Entimus imperialis. Electron microscopy identified the chitin and air assemblies inside the scales as domains of a single-network diamond (Fd3m) photonic crystal. We visualized the topology of the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) by imaging scatterometry, and we reconstructed the complete photonic band structure diagram (PBSD) of the chitinous photonic crystal from reflectance spectra. Comparison with calculated PBSDs indeed showed a perfect overlap. The unique method of non-invasive hemispherical imaging of the FBZ provides key insights for the investigation of photonic crystals in the visible wavelength range. The characterized extremely large biophotonic nanostructures of E. imperialis are structurally optimized for high reflectance and may thus be well suited for use as a template for producing novel photonic devices, e.g. through biomimicry or direct infiltration from dielectric material.},

However, we believe its true potential to be in photonics and optoelectronics, where the combination of its unique optical and electronic properties can be fully exploited, even in the absence of a bandgap, and the linear dispersion of the Dirac electrons enables ultra-wide-band tunability. The rise of graphene in photonics and optoelectronics is shown by several recent results, ranging from solar cells and light emitting devices, to touch screens, photodetectors and ultrafast lasers.

However, the performance of electronic circuits is now becoming rather limited when digital information needs to be sent from one point to another. Photonics offers an effective solution to this problem by implementing optical communication systems based on optical fibers and photonic circuits. Unfortunately, the micrometer-scale bulky components of photonics have limited the integration of these components into electronic chips, which are now measured in nanometers. Surface plasmon-based circuits, which merge electronics and photonics at the nanoscale, may offer a solution to this size-compatibility problem.

abstract = {Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are responsible for exotic optical phenomena, including negative refraction, surface enhanced Raman scattering, and nanoscale focusing of light. Although many materials support SPPs, the choice of metal for most applications has been based on traditional plasmonic materials (Ag, Au) because there have been no side-by-side comparisons of the different materials on well-defined, nanostructured surfaces. Here, we report a platform that not only enabled rapid screening of a wide range of metals under different excitation conditions and dielectric environments, but also identified new and unexpected materials for biosensing applications. Nanopyramidal gratings were used to generate plasmon dispersion diagrams for Al, Ag, Au, Cu, and Pd. Surprisingly, the SPP coupling efficiencies of Cu and Al exceeded widely used plasmonic materials under certain excitation conditions. Furthermore, grazing angle excitation led to the highest refractive index sensitivities (figure of merit >85) reported at optical frequencies because of extremely narrow SPP resonances (full-width-at-half-minimum <6 nm or 7 meV). Finally, our screening process revealed that Ag, with the highest sensitivity, was not necessarily the preferred material for detecting molecules. We discovered that Au and even Pd, a weak plasmonic material, showed comparable index shifts on formation of a protein monolayer.},

Optimized grating structure integrated photodetectors exhibited more than sevenfold photocurrent enhancement.

Networks of Ag nanowires are made with wire diameters of 45-110 nm and a pitch of 500, 700, and 1000 nm. Anomalous optical transmission is observed, with an averaged transmission up to 91\% for the best transmitting network and sheet resistances as low as 6.5 $\Omega$/sq for the best conducting network. Our most dilute networks show lower sheet resistance and higher optical transmittance than an 80 nm thick layer of ITO sputtered on glass. By comparing measurements and simulations, we identify four distinct physical phenomena that govern the transmission of light through the networks: all related to the excitation of localized surface plasmons and surface plasmon polaritons on the wires. The insights given in this paper provide the key guidelines for designing high-transmittance and low-resistance nanowire electrodes for optoelectronic devices, including thin-film solar cells. For the latter, we discuss the general design principles to use the nanowire electrodes also as a light trapping scheme.},

abstract = {The ability to manipulate optical fields and the energy flow of light is central to modern information and communication technologies, as well as quantum information processing schemes. However, because photons do not possess charge, a way of controlling them efficiently by electrical means has so far proved elusive. A promising way to achieve electric control of light could be through plasmon polaritons—coupled excitations of photons and charge carriers—in graphene. In this two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, it is expected that plasmon polaritons and their associated optical fields can readily be tuned electrically by varying the graphene carrier density. Although evidence of optical graphene plasmon resonances has recently been obtained spectroscopically, no experiments so far have directly resolved propagating plasmons in real space. Here we launch and detect propagating optical plasmons in tapered graphene nanostructures using near-field scattering microscopy with infrared excitation light. We provide real-space images of plasmon fields, and find that the extracted plasmon wavelength is very short—more than 40 times smaller than the wavelength of illumination. We exploit this strong optical field confinement to turn a graphene nanostructure into a tunable resonant plasmonic cavity with extremely small mode volume. The cavity resonance is controlled in situ by gating the graphene, and in particular, complete switching on and off of the plasmon modes is demonstrated, thus paving the way towards graphene-based optical transistors. This successful alliance between nanoelectronics and nano-optics enables the development of active subwavelength-scale optics and a plethora of nano-optoelectronic devices and functionalities, such as tunable metamaterials, nanoscale optical processing, and strongly enhanced light–matter interactions for quantum devices and biosensing applications.},

abstract = {Laser science has been successful in producing increasingly high-powered, faster and smaller coherent light sources. Examples of recent advances are microscopic lasers that can reach the diffraction limit, based on photonic crystals, metal-clad cavities and nanowires. However, such lasers are restricted, both in optical mode size and physical device dimension, to being larger than half the wavelength of the optical field, and it remains a key fundamental challenge to realize ultracompact lasers that can directly generate coherent optical fields at the nanometre scale, far beyond the diffraction limit. A way of addressing this issue is to make use of surface plasmons, which are capable of tightly localizing light, but so far ohmic losses at optical frequencies have inhibited the realization of truly nanometre-scale lasers based on such approaches. A recent theoretical work predicted that such losses could be significantly reduced while maintaining ultrasmall modes in a hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Here we report the experimental demonstration of nanometre-scale plasmonic lasers, generating optical modes a hundred times smaller than the diffraction limit. We realize such lasers using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide consisting of a high-gain cadmium sulphide semiconductor nanowire, separated from a silver surface by a 5-nm-thick insulating gap. Direct measurements of the emission lifetime reveal a broad-band enhancement of the nanowire's exciton spontaneous emission rate by up to six times owing to the strong mode confinement and the signature of apparently threshold-less lasing. Because plasmonic modes have no cutoff, we are able to demonstrate downscaling of the lateral dimensions of both the device and the optical mode. Plasmonic lasers thus offer the possibility of exploring extreme interactions between light and matter, opening up new avenues in the fields of active photonic circuits, bio-sensing and quantum information technology.},

abstract = {We report that the effect of an external magnetic field on the propagation of surface plasmons can be effectively modified through the coupling between localized (LSP) and propagating (SPP) surface plasmons. When these plasmon modes do not interact, the main effect of the magnetic field is a modification of the wavevector of the SPP mode, leaving the LSP virtually unaffected. Once both modes start to interact, there is a strong variation of the magnetic field induced modification of the SPP dispersion curve and, simultaneously, the LSP mode becomes sensitive to the magnetic field.},

@article{Yu2010,
abstract = {Surface plasmons have found a broad range of applications in photonic devices at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. In contrast, longer-wavelength surface electromagnetic waves, known as Sommerfeld or Zenneck waves, are characterized by poor confinement to surfaces and are therefore difficult to control using conventional metallo-dielectric plasmonic structures. However, patterning the surface with subwavelength periodic features can markedly reduce the asymptotic surface plasmon frequency, leading to 'spoof' surface plasmons with subwavelength confinement at infrared wavelengths and beyond, which mimic surface plasmons at much shorter wavelengths. We demonstrate that by directly sculpting designer spoof surface plasmon structures that tailor the dispersion of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons on the highly doped semiconductor facets of terahertz quantum cascade lasers, the performance of the lasers can be markedly enhanced. Using a simple one-dimensional grating design, the beam divergence of the lasers was reduced from approximately 180 degrees to approximately 10 degrees, the directivity was improved by over 10 decibels and the power collection efficiency was increased by a factor of about six compared with the original unpatterned devices. We achieve these improvements without compromising high-temperature performance of the lasers.},

Two distinct types of resonance have been predicted for incident radiation with E-field perpendicular to the long axis of the wires. The first resonance has been identified as a cavity mode resonance that is associated with transmission enhancement. The second resonance has been identified as an entirely new horizontal plasmon resonance on the incident (and transmission) surfaces of the wires of the grating. Normal surface plasmon modes are investigated on discontinuous gratings, and their relation to those found on continuous gratings is highlighted by focusing on the perturbation effect of the discontinuities. It is shown that the new horizontal plasmon mode is in no way related to the well known diffractively coupled surface plasmon, and is shown to have a particle plasmon-like nature. It is therefore termed a horizontal particle plasmon, and may be either an uncoupled horizontal particle plasmon resonance (a 1-dimensional particle plasmon) or a coupled horizontal particle plasmon resonance (a 2-dimensional particle plasmon) depending on the height of the grating. It is shown that this resonance may result in a reflection efficiency that is very high, even when the grating would be optically thin if it were a homogeneous film, therefore, it behaves as an inverse wire grid polariser as it reflects more TM than TE incident radiation.},

abstract = {A new hybrid method for the analysis of diffractive optical elements, which combines fully vectorial and scalar theories, is presented. It is suitable for use with elements of arbitrary large zone, even when the local feature size is of the order of the wavelength. To assess its applicability, we have performed cross-checking tests. The model is shown to accurately predict many optical properties of diffractive optical elements based on two-dimensional artificial dielectrics, like the useful energy diffracted into the order of interest or the deterministic loss into high diffraction orders for an illumination with a wavelength different from the design wavelength or for highly oblique incidence.},

The antenna length at resonance is considerably shorter than one-half the wavelength of the incident light. This is in contradiction to classical antenna theory but in qualitative accordance with computer simulations that take into account the finite metallic conductivity at optical frequencies. Because optical antennas link propagating radiation and confined/enhanced optical fields, they should find applications in optical characterization, manipulation of nanostructures, and optical information processing.},

@article{Stavenga2011,
abstract = {The elytra of the Japanese jewel beetle Chrysochroa fulgidissima are metallic green with purple stripes. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy demonstrated that the elytral surface is approximately flat. The accordingly specular green and purple areas have, with normal illumination, 100-150 nm broad reflectance bands, peaking at about 530 and 700 nm. The bands shift progressively towards shorter wavelengths with increasing oblique illumination, and the reflection then becomes highly polarized. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the epicuticle of the green and purple areas consists of stacks of 16 and 12 layers, respectively. Assuming gradient refractive index values of the layers between 1.6 and 1.7 and applying the classical multilayer theory allowed modelling of the measured polarization- and angle-dependent reflectance spectra. The extreme polarized iridescence exhibited by the elytra of the jewel beetle may have a function in intraspecific recognition.},

abstract = {We propose a new way to design gratings with desired diffraction properties by using subwavelength feature sizes perpendicular to the ordinary superwavelength grating period. This is different from well-known one-dimensional binary-blazed gratings that use a structuring along the grating period and thus opens new flexibility in generating arbitrary effective-index distributions in the direction of the grating period. Since the subwavelength features form contiguous areas, they are called area-coded effective medium structures (ACES). Compared with well-known binary subwavelength structures in two-dimensional arrangements consisting of pillars, ACES are more stable and have comparable efficiency properties. As an example we show how to design in principle a four-level area-coded effective medium grating, compare the efficiency of ACES with binary-blazed and \'{e}chelette gratings, and optimize the subwavelength period of ACES.},

Devices with advanced functionalities, such as balanced SPP power splitter, and SPP wavelength demultiplexer are demonstrated with over 75\% of power efficiencies at reasonable working distances of less than several wavelengths.},

The coupling efficiency to the two propagation directions away from the slits is determined by leakage radiation microscopy, when the angle of incidence of the pump beam is changed from 0° to 20°. We find that preferential coupling of SPPs into one direction can be achieved for non-normal incidence in the case of single slits and slit pairs. The proportion of SPP excited into one direction can be in excess of 90\%. We further provide a simple model of the process, and directly compare the performances of the two approaches.},

abstract = {Plasmonic waveguides can guide light along metal-dielectric interfaces with propagating wave vectors of greater magnitude than are available in free space and hence with propagating wavelengths shorter than those in vacuum. This is a necessary, rather than sufficient, condition for subwavelength confinement of the optical mode. By use of the reflection pole method, the two-dimensional modal solutions for single planar waveguides as well as adjacent waveguide systems are solved. We demonstrate that, to achieve subwavelength pitches, a metal-insulator-metal geometry is required with higher confinement factors and smaller spatial extent than conventional insulator-metal-insulator structures. The resulting trade-off between propagation and confinement for surface plasmons is discussed, and optimization by materials selection is described.},

By proper design of the working wavelength and the thickness of silver that allows access to a broad spectrum of subwavelength features, we also showed that arbitrary nanostructures can be imaged with good fidelity.

Considerable recent research has focused on energy absorption processes, and plasmonic nanostructures have been shown to enhance the performance of photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic cells. Although reducing metallic losses is a widely sought goal in nanophotonics, the design of nanostructured 'black' super absorbers from materials comprising only lossless dielectric materials and highly reflective noble metals represents a new research direction. Here we demonstrate an ultrathin (260 nm) plasmonic super absorber consisting of a metal-insulator-metal stack with a nanostructured top silver film composed of crossed trapezoidal arrays. Our super absorber yields broadband and polarization-independent resonant light absorption over the entire visible spectrum (400-700 nm) with an average measured absorption of 0.71 and simulated absorption of 0.85. Proposed nanostructured absorbers open a path to realize ultrathin black metamaterials based on resonant absorption.},

This limitation can be overcome by creating a periodic texture on the exit side of a single aperture in a metal film. The transmitted light emerges from the aperture as a beam with a small angular divergence (approximately +/-3 degrees ) whose directionality can be controlled. This finding is especially surprising, considering that the radiating region is mainly confined to an area with lateral dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the light. The device occupies no more than one cubic micrometer and, when combined with enhanced transmission, suggests that a wide range of photonic applications is possible.},

The substrate consisted of a gold grating prepared by wet chemical treatment of a commercial recordable compact disk. A custom-built floating pin microspotter was constructed to deliver solutions containing omega-functionalized linear alkanethiols to the grating surface and produce an array of sensor elements with different exposed functional end groups. This array platform can be used to study biomolecular interactions in a label-free, sensitive, and high-throughput format. To illustrate the performance of this device, a test protein (bovine serum albumin) was exposed to sensor elements containing an array of functionalized alkanethiols possessing either activated carboxylic acid-, amine-, or hydroxyl-terminated regions. Local changes in plasmon resonance were monitored in a fixed-angle imaging configuration. Plasmon images clearly distinguish the degree of protein attachment at the various surfaces. The molecular binding events on the grating were also confirmed by ellipsometry. This grating-based SPR imaging platform represents a simple and robust method for performing label-free, high-sensitivity, and high-throughput detection of biomolecular interactions.},

The LSPP band gap was observed experimentally with the absorbance spectra and its angle dependence characterized with different incident angles. Such a T-shaped structure with a LSPP band gap can be widely exploited in various applications, such as emitters and sensors.},

abstract = {Broadband optical reflectors generally function through coherent scattering from systems comprising one of three designs: overlapped; chirped; or chaotic multilayer reflectors. For each, the requirement to scatter a broad band of wavelengths is met through the presence of a variation in nanostructural periodicity running perpendicular to the systems' outer surfaces. Consequently, the requisite total thickness of the multilayer can often be in excess of 50 mum. Here, we report the discovery and the microwave-assisted characterization of a natural system that achieves excellent optical broadband reflectivity but that is less than 1 mum thick. This system, found on the wing scales of the butterfly Argyrophorus argenteus, comprises a distinctive variation in periodicity that runs parallel to the reflecting surface, rather than perpendicular to it. In this way, the requirement for an extensively thick system is removed.},

abstract = {We study the enhanced transmission through compound subwavelength rectangular hole arrays in perfect electronically conductive films. It is shown that phase effects become important in the enhanced transmission when extra rectangular holes are added per period. There are two types of resonance mechanisms due to the phase effects: one is the localized waveguide mode phase resonance and the other is the surface mode phase resonance. The localized waveguide mode phase resonances, which are related to the number of holes per period and their relative positions, split the waveguide resonance peak into several peaks. The surface mode phase resonances, which appear evidently only for some special arrangements of holes in a unit cell, lead to the suppression of some surface mode resonance peaks. Our approach is advantageous to modulate the enhanced transmission in metallic hole arrays in the terahertz or microwave frequency regime. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

Large holes, with cut-off below the onset of diffraction (due to the hole periodicity), are able to support multiple modes in transmission when the depth of the holes is sufficient to support quantisation in the propagation direction. Small holes, with cut-off above the onset of diffraction however only support two coupled surface modes (symmetric and anti-symmetric) below diffraction.},

abstract = {Intrinsic coherent anti-Stokes emission is observed in lithographically patterned gold nanowires. Polarization dependent measurements reveal that the nanostructure's anti-Stokes response is polarized in the direction of the transverse surface plasmon resonance of the wire. We have used specially fabricated gold nanozigzag wires that are modulated in height between 20 and 80 nm to demonstrate tuning of the plasmon polarizability through control of wire height. Stronger anti-Stokes emission is shown to correlate with structures that support higher plasmon polarizability, underlining the primary role of the transverse plasmon resonance in the generation of anti-Stokes radiation from gold nanostructures. Our results also point out that a potential surface-enhanced coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) assay for detecting the vibrational response of surface-tethered molecules needs to include a mechanism for separating the molecular response from the strong intrinsic anti-Stokes emission of the metallic nanosubstrate.},

@article{Hooper2003,
abstract = {Recent investigations into high-aspect-ratio short-pitch metal grating structures have shown that it is possible to excite surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) even in the zero-order region of the spectrum. The predominant reason this is possible is that extremely large bandgaps occur in the SPP dispersion curves, which are caused by the large depths, and heights, of the structures. The form of the resultant dispersion curves has also been found to be highly dependent on the shape of the grating profile. We present an extension to a previously published paper that described the nature of the SPPs excited on narrow-ridged short-pitch metal gratings in the classical mount by considering the case in which the radiation is incident at nonzero azimuthal angles (the conical mount). In particular, we consider the case of 90 degrees and 45 degrees azimuthal angles and discuss the coupling to the SPP modes and the way in which polarization conversion is evident on such structures.},

This fact has been understood as a consequence of the evident symmetry imposed by the incident wave and it has not been questioned up to now. Here we show that, apart from this highly symmetrical configuration, the polarization conversion efficiency has local maxima also in other cases which do not exhibit such an evident symmetry. We demonstrate that the occurrence of both the local maxima for the new configurations and the maximum corresponding to \&b.phis; 45\% are a consequence of internal symmetries imposed by the propagation direction of the resonantly excited surface plasmons.},

When the grooves are at 45� to the plane of incidence maximum p-s conversion is obtained. Conversion efficiencies of up to 66\% have been recorded for silver-coated gratings of appropriate depth. By scanning the angle of incidence and using a crossed polariser on the detector a strong resonance peak is observed. The application of this phenomenon to optical sensing is considered.},

abstract = {We explore the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) arrays of silver nanoparticles, focussing our attention on structures for which the individual particles in isolation support both dipolar and quadrupolar localised surface plasmon modes. For individual spheres we show that when dipolar and quadrupolar modes are excited simultaneously, interference leads to most of the scattered light being radiated in the forward direction. This is in contrast to what happens when each mode is excited on its own. We further show, using finite-element modelling that when such particles are assembled into square 2D arrays, the dipolar and quadrupolar modes can combine to produce a single peak in the optical density of the array. By simulating the field distributions associated with these modes we are able to illustrate the dual-mode character of this feature in the optical density. We have extended our examination of this effect by considering how the optical density of these arrays changes with incident angle for two polarisations (s and p).},

A detailed analysis shows that electromagnetic resonances are involved and their nature strongly depends on the polarization. When the incident electric field is parallel to the cross-section of the grating, the resonance is provoked by the excitation of surface plasmons. For the orthogonal polarization, total absorption occurs for deep gratings only, when the grooves behave like resonant optical cavities. It is possible to reduce the optimal grating height by filling the grooves with a high refractive index material.},

Surface modes are also observed on highly conducting surfaces perforated by holes. We establish a close connection between the two, showing that electromagnetic waves in both materials are governed by an effective permittivity of the same plasma form. The size and spacing of holes can readily be controlled on all relevant length scales, which allows the creation of designer surface plasmons with almost arbitrary dispersion in frequency and in space, opening new vistas in surface plasmon optics.},

abstract = {Using large-area (cm2) single-crystal mica sheets as the templating substrate, we have created correspondingly large template-stripped (TS) gold films (thickness 82 +/- 2 nm) that appear smooth to within 0.2 nm rms roughness over their entire area. These gold films, created without the use of any releasing solvent, are characterized using AFM, X-ray diffraction, multiple beam interferometric fringes of equal chromatic order (FECO), and contact angle measurements. Being molecularly smooth over large areas and (adjustably) semitransparent, these films are especially suitable for use in the surface force balance (SFB), as shown by measurements of the normal force (F) versus distance (D) profiles between such a flat gold surface and a bare mica surface in water. The F(D) profiles are in good agreement with DLVO theory down to molecular contact and indicate that the gold surface is negatively charged under water.},

The device creates the illusion that light propagates through empty flat space, whereas in physical space, light is bent around a hidden interior or seems to run backward in space or time. All of the previous proposals for invisibility require materials with extreme properties. Here we show that transformation optics of a curved, non-Euclidean space (such as the surface of a virtual sphere) relax these requirements and can lead to invisibility in a broad band of the spectrum.},

abstract = {With a conventional lens sharpness of the image is always limited by the wavelength of light. An unconventional alternative to a lens, a slab of negative refractive index material, has the power to focus all Fourier components of a 2D image, even those that do not propagate in a radiative manner. Such "superlenses" can be realized in the microwave band with current technology. Our simulations show that a version of the lens operating at the frequency of visible light can be realized in the form of a thin slab of silver. This optical version resolves objects only a few nanometers across.},
